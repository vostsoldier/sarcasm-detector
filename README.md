About this game:
This game was a idea made out of the maniac me and a fondness for Wordle.
On one light night in december, I felt the need to create a sarcasm detector.
That sarcasm detector, coupled with my stress and incompentence, evolved into this.
Using Python and basic HTML/CSS, this lightweight game is fun for dictionary lovers!

Advice from others:
I only expected a couple of doubloons from this project, thinking it was very boring and put very little effort at first.
My classmate, who saw me code this project, wanted a little demo, which I provided.
To my surprise, he enjoyed it, and even more people joined in.
I appreciate the support everyone has given me, whether it be from the votes or feedback recieved!

I hope to see everyone on the leaderboard!
